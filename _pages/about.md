本站介绍
======
欢迎来到我的博客。首先感谢这个博客模板的[提供者](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)。这个网站主要是站主用于记录研究时的笔记，遇到的一些离谱的问题以及分享一些个人感悟。出于一时的兴起，并且听信“技术人员必须要有一个个人博客”这种夸张的论调，便萌生了写博客的想法。希望为现在已经逐步变成信息孤岛的互联网做出自己的信息输出，同时也方便自己查阅过去的知识。


关于站主
======

我现在是中国科学院大学的一名在读硕士研究生，目前主攻的方向是多模态大模型。对人工智能方面的各个方向都有着兴趣，包括计算机视觉、自然语言处理、深度学习、强化学习等。同时对计算机方面的知识也有一定的了解，梦想可以成为一名优秀的全栈工程师。

希望可以将生活中的一切主观和客观事物都通过量化进行分析和处理，以尽量客观且科学的方式看待这个世界并处理好身边的各种问题。

Welcome
======
Welcome to my blog! First of all, many thanks to the [provider](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) of this template.  
This site mainly serves as a notebook for my research, a log of bizarre problems I run into, and a place to share personal thoughts. On a whim—and after hearing the exaggerated claim that “every technologist must have a personal blog”—I decided to start writing. I hope to add my own tiny output to an Internet that is gradually becoming a cluster of information islands, while also giving myself an easy way to look up things I once knew.

About me
======
I am currently a master’s student at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, focusing on multimodal large models. I’m broadly interested in anything related to AI: computer vision, natural language processing, deep learning, reinforcement learning, you name it. I also enjoy general computer-science topics and dream of becoming a solid full-stack engineer.

I believe almost every subjective or objective aspect of life can be quantified, analyzed, and handled in an objective, scientific way—and I’m constantly trying to see the world through that lens.
